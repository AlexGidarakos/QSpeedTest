* libspeedtest:                                                 |
  Fixed a bug causing failed attempts at restoring files from   |
  the embedded resources when running an executable linked      |
  against a static version of libspeedtest                      |
  Proper fix for a compiler warning on non-Windows Oses         |
  Some fixes in the gui/gui.pro file                            |
  Updated embedded resources (hostlist version 201007191858 by  |
  Someonefromhell, increased ping timeout sec from 1 to 2 in    |
  preferences file)                                             |

* libspeedtest:                                                 |
  Total code rewrite                                            |
  Added serial download testing per download group              |
  Implemented persistent settings system                        |
  Implemented report file saving system                         |
  Use of non-blocking methods for increased GUI responsiveness  |
  One Google Chart generated per download group                 |
  Google Charts automatically adjust pixel height based on the  |
  number of ping groups and number of hosts in each D/L group   |
  Google Charts automatically adjust X-axis scaling in the D/L  |
  speed results, when the ADSL2+/24 Mbps threshold is exceeded  |
  Google Charts contain up to 5 different colours. Colours will |
  cycle when chart elements > 5                                 |
  Google Charts in GIF format give a filesize reduction to 1/2  |
  approx. of the original filesizes                             |
  Cosmetic changes in the report output. bbCode output adjusted |
  to decrease post height                                       |
  In non-Windows OSes, a static version of libspeedtest is      |
  created and linked inside the other executables, to avoid     |
  problems with LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and such   |

* QSpeedTest: Major interface changes!                          |
  Implemented menu system                                       |
  Moved some push buttons to menuitems                          |
  Added keyboard shortcuts for some menu actions                |
  Save report menuitems with a dialog that asks the report's    |
  destination path and filename. A default filename is provided |
  based on test's timestamp                                     |
  Added Preferences dialog with persistent program settings.    |
  The settings are: Test mode, no. of pings per host, no. of    |
  threads used for parallel pinging, ping timeout in sec, no.   |
  of sec each download test will run and URL that is checked    |
  for hostlist updates. A Defaults button will return to some   |
  preselected hardcoded default options                         |
  Log window moved to a QComboBox on the bottom of the GUI      |
  Menuitems for clearing the log and copying it to clipboard    |
  Added a new test mode which only prints host info             |
  Created and added a program logo and icon                     |
                                                                |
* QSpeedTestCLI: No release for this revision! Patience please! |

* libspeedtest:                                                 |
  Fixed bug that caused errors when writing new target list INI |
  under Linux                                                   |


revision 34 - 20100705                                          |
* HTML and vB code output: Added second Google Chart URL for    |
  the bandwidth test results                                    |


revision 33 - 20100704                                          |
* Feature request: Added progress bar to indicate the progress  |
  of a speed test                                               |
* HTML and vB code output: Added a Google Chart URL showing     |
  average latency per ping group                                |
* HTML and vB code output: Fixed a small bug regarding the      |
  "Speed only" mode                                             |


revision 32 - 20100703                                          |
* Code refactoring for modular structure: libspeedtest library  |
  created, split source code files to separate directories etc. |


revision 31 - 20100701                                          |
* QSpeedTest: Too many calls to processEvents() in the FileHost |
  class' "updateBytes" slot could potentially lead to crashes,  |
  so this statement was removed                                 |


revision 30 - 20100701                                          |
* Major changes in console, HTML and vbCode output              |

revision 29 - 20100630                                          |
* Reverted to r24                                               |
* Always check for updated target list first                    |
* QSpeedTest: Clicking Stop during domestic download speed test |
  did not cancel international speed test as well. Fixed        |
* QSpeedTest: OS detection done when initializing program. This |
  trades a little time during program startup for faster        |
  printing of host information every time a test run starts     |
* QSpeedTest: More responsive GUI during download speed tests   |
* QSpeedTestCLI: A small cosmetic fix in stdout output          |
* QSpeedTestCLI: CTRL+C now properly stops the program          |


revision 28 - 20100630                                          |
* QSpeedTestCLI: Previous fix was not submitted properly        |


revision 27 - 20100630                                          |

* Bumped QSpeedTestCLI revision to r6                           |
* QSpeedTest r27: Fixed a nasty bug that crashed the program    |
  when pressing for the 2nd time the stop button during a       |
  download speed test                                           |
* QSpeedTestCLI r6: A small cosmetic fix in stdout output       |


revision 26 - 20100630                                          |
* Bumped QSpeedTest revision to r26                             |

* QSpeedTest r26: Fixed a small stop button bug                 |


revision 25 - 20100630                                          |
* Bumped QSpeedTest revision to r25                             |
* Bumped QSpeedTestCLI revision to r4                           |
* Both: Always check for updated target list first              |
* Both: New method for measuring downloaded bytes from each file|
  host. No global variable and QMutex are needed. Hopefully it  |
  will solve the "outrageously big speeds reported" bug         |


revision 24 - 20100630                                          |
* Bumped QSpeedTest revision to r24                             |
* Bumped QSpeedTestCLI revision to r3                           |
* Both: Fixed a small bug which led to not downloading an       |
  available online update of the target list                    |
* Both: Instead of overwriting an existing target list with a   |
  new update, the old list gets renamed with an additional .bak |
  extension                                                     |
* Updated embedded target list                                  |


revision 23 - 20100629                                          |
* QSpeedTestCLI r2: cosmetic changes                            |
* QSpeedTest r23: cosmetic changes                              |
* Both: Access total bytes downloaded global variable only after|
  mutex locking. Perhaps this will solve the occasional bug of  |
  the outrageously big download speeds                          |
* Both: Two discrete download speed tests, one targets domestic |
  servers and the other international servers                   |
* Updated embedded target list                                  |

revision 20 - 20100608                                          |
* Recompiled program and Qt DLLs reduced file sizes and removed |
  dependency upon libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll and mingwm10.dll. These 2  |
  files are no longer included in the new Qt DLLs' compressed   |
  archive that the project distributes                          |
* Changed About box's default size from 320x240 to 400x300 for  |

revision 19 - 20100604                                          |
* Bug fix: Loading of a newly downloaded target list led to     |
  duplicate download target entries                             |
* Bug fix: In HTML output, targets' URLs were missing the       |
  http:// prefix                                                |
* Bug fix (possible): Limit the decimal precision in QString    |
  conversion of download speed results (no decimal digits for   |
  Kbps, three decimal digits for MB/sec)                        |
* In addition to clipboard copying, the code output buttons now |
  also launch the appropriate application to view the output    |
* In HTML and vB output, targets are sorted by RTT in ascending |
  order                                                         |

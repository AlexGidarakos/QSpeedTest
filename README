QSpeedTest is a GUI tool written in C++ and Qt for evaluating the
latency and speed of an Internet or LAN access by pinging and
concurrently downloading test files from a customized list of target
servers. It is currently hosted on SourceForge.net as free software,

1. Requirements for Windows users
In order to run, this program requires some of the Qt DLLs present in
the system, either in a folder included in the PATH variable or in the
same folder as the program. For your convenience, a suitable compressed
archive with these DLLs is available here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/qspeedtest/files/qspeedtest-win32-required-dlls


2. Build instructions
Provided that you have installed the necessary Qt development libraries
and build tools, all you have to do in order to build binaries from the
source code is to navigate to a directory containing the source and
enter the two following commands:
    qmake
    make
If you feel more comfortable working with an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment), I recommend installing the complete Qt SDK by
Nokia, which contains all the necessary libraries and build tools, as
well as the excellent Qt Creator IDE. You can install the SDK either
via your distribution's repositories (if you are using a Linux distro)
or from binaries available in Nokia's Qt homepage:
    http://qt.nokia.com
In Qt Creator, you only need to load QSpeedTest's main project file
(qspeedtest.pro) and use the command under "Build" menu
